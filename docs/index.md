# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the [OSTIS Metasystem](https://github.com/ostis-ai/ostis-metasystem)! This guide provides an overview of the OSTIS Metasystem within the framework of the OSTIS Technology, its components, and its applications for developing next-generation intelligent computer systems.

## What is the OSTIS Metasystem?

The OSTIS Metasystem is an **intelligent computer system** designed to provide comprehensive support for all stages of the life cycle of intelligent systems, known as ostis-systems, which are developed using the [OSTIS Technology](https://github.com/ostis-ai). It serves as both a project management system and a knowledge portal for designing, producing, operating, and evolving semantically compatible hybrid intelligent systems.
